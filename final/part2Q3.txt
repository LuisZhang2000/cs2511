Decorator Pattern is a structural pattern that wraps an object through class extension and allows more functionality
to be added to an object during runtime. It prefers composition over inheritance. 

Visitor pattern is a behavioural pattern that adds extra functionality to existing objects through a Visitor class
without having to modify them (open-closed principle).

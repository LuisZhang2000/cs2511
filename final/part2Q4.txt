Factory	Method and Abstract Factory Methods are both creational patterns.
Factory Method allows the creation of objects without having to specify the exact class of the object,
whereas Abstract Factory Method lets you produce FAMILIES of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Therefore Factory Method is useful for creating one type of object while Abstract Factory Pattern is useful for creating
families of objects.

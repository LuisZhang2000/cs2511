PART 2

1a) Encapsulation is violated, there are no restrictions on how the public instance variables can be modified. Account number and balance should not
be visible or able to be directly modified by the client.
b) the printStatementHeader is a static method in the Account class, so it will call the method inside Account instead of SavingsAccount
c) To make the classes immutable:
- make accountNumber and balance private
- add getters only (no setters) for instance variables
- add a constructor which takes the instance variables as arguments

2a) Strategy 
*b) Visitor
*c) Singleton
